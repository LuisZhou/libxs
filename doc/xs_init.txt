xs_init(3)
==========


NAME
----
xs_init - initialise Crossroads context


SYNOPSIS
--------
*void *xs_init (int 'io_threads');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _xs_init()_ function initialises a Crossroads 'context'.

The 'io_threads' argument specifies the size of the thread pool to handle
I/O operations. If your application is using only the 'inproc' transport for
messaging you may set this to zero, otherwise set it to at least one.

.Thread safety
A 'context' is thread safe and may be shared among as many application
threads as necessary, without any additional locking required on the part of
the caller.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _xs_init()_ function shall return an opaque handle to the initialised
'context' if successful. Otherwise it shall return NULL and set 'errno' to one
of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
An invalid number of 'io_threads' was requested.
