Release 1.0.0 (15 March 2012)
-----------------------------

Initial release.  Changes listed here are as compared to libzmq release
3.1.

New features:

* The io_threads argument has been removed from xs_init(), and the default
  number of I/O threads per context is now 1.
* Context options added - see xs_setctxopt(3):
  * The XS_IO_THREADS context option allows the user to specify the size of
    the worker thread pool.
  * The XS_MAX_SOCKETS context option allows the user to specify the
    maximum number of sockets that can exist in parallel within a context.
* Allow setting the source address for TCP connections - see xs_tcp(7).
* ZeroMQ drop-in compatibility mode, enabled by the --enable-libzmq option
  to configure. This is a binary compatible emulation of the ZeroMQ 2.1.11
  API, for details see zmq(7).

Bugfixes:

* Fix pgm_receiver.cpp: zmq_assert (pending_bytes == 0). (LIBZMQ-205)
* Fix assertion in pgm_sender_t::plug(). (LIBZMQ-303)
* Race condition in zmq_term() fixed.
* Message loss when a SUB socket disconnects fixed.
* Fix data loss for PUB/SUB and unidirectional transports. (LIBZMQ-268)
* Bug in linger implementation fixed.
* Fix IPC transport domain socket stream file not being removed when
  connection is closed.
* Removal of pipe from dist_t fixed.
* Only use AI_V4MAPPED if defined, and don't use it on FreeBSD.

Optimisation:

* Several optimisations to reduce the memory size of PUB/SUB subscription
  map.
* Avoid one extra call to poll() when there are no more data to send.

Build:

* MSVC build updated to use MSVC2010 instead of MSVC2008.
* configure prints out a summary of XS configuration.

Self tests:

* Many more tests have been added, see the tests/ subdirectory.
* The self tests can now be run from a MSVC build, see the "tests" project.
